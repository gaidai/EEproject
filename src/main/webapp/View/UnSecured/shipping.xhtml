                    <p><p>Order two or more items at any price, or one item totaling $50 &#43; for FREE Standard Shipping* (4-5 Business Days)! If you do not meet those requirements, Standard Shipping (4-5 Business Days) is $3.95.</p>

          <p>In a hurry? We also offer Expedited Shipping!</p>

          <p>2-Business Day Shipping** $9.99</p>

          <p>1-Business Day Shipping $14.99</p>

          <p>*Free standard shipping (4-5 Business Days) is automatically applied to orders with two or more items or one item totaling $50 or more before tax. Free shipping is applied before coupon and before gift card is used (when applicable).</p>

          <p>** Shipping speeds are based on carrier transit times and do not include the time it takes to handle and pack a shipment. All expected delivery dates are provided at the checkout page. However, due to payment type, and that company&#39;s approval procedures, there could be a delay in shipping your order if the billing information is inaccurate, or if your billing and shipping addresses are different. Expedited shipping is not available for shipments to Hawaii, Alaska, U.S. Territories, PO Boxes, or APO/FPO addresses. Please allow additional time for orders shipped to these addresses. Expedited shipping is also not available for shipments including items containing hazardous material by the Department of Transportation (fragrances, nail polish, etc) and some watches due to the batteries they contain.</p>
